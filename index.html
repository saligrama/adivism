In fact, President Obama had left an extensive set of recommendations and a dedicated pandemic response team for Trump upon leaving office, the latter of which was partially dismantled in 2018.</p>

In 2020, however, that assurance seems to have come in vain. With its new national security law, Beijing has brought its heavy-handed attempts to stifle criticism to Hong Kong.</p>

While such a count should in theory be strictly about information gathering, its operational details soon became highly polarized. Many argue that the debate over the details of the census has come to a head in 2020.</p>
